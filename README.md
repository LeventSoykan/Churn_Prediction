# Churn Prediction
This is a practice on Kaggle Telco Customer Churn dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). <br>
The objective is to predict whether a customer will churn using the variable.<br>
The target class is imbalanced, therefore I Used f1_score & recall rate for model tuning and evaluation. <br>
I started with a simple EDA on numeric/categorical variables and applied 6 different machine learning models.<br>
